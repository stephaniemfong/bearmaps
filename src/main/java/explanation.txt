I had a quiz to study for late last night, whoops I procrastinated, and couldn’t finish the gold points on time.

It was also partially my fault, I finished the regular part of the project over the weekend, and decided last minute to start on the gold points.

For future, I don’t think the time allotted for this project should be any longer, I think it was mainly me :))

Also, grace period!
